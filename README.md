# MiniOS

A microcontroller instructional operating system (work in progress)


# Origins

MiniOS was originally written as an instructional OS for teaching Operating Systems at the University of Northern BC. This is more or less explained [here](http://embedntks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MiniOS-Defense-Slides.pptx). (Please note the version initially uploaded here is not exactly the same as the one referenced in the slides)

Over the years other people have contributed to it (really only Conan Veitch), and it has become more of a microcontroller OS, but the instruction aspects remains. 


# The book

There's an instructional guide detailing step by step how to build MiniOS from scratch. Where is it? It is for the msot part complete, but we and the other author have been busy and are still working out the details. Should you want a copy for academic purposes free to send an e-mail.

# What is it used for (other than instruction)?

Still exploring this, but the idea so far is to take advantage of deployable apps.


# On what platforms does it run?

Currently the SAM4S Xplained Pro.


# Compiling Source code

Source code is an Atmel Studio Project.


# Running Sample Apps

Samples apps (.bin) are in /sample_apps/apps_known_to_work. Run them using the console. As shown [here](https://youtu.be/xwV5s2CTYqg) and [here](https://youtu.be/HzgY5F7Pba4)

To write your own, you have to use the template in /sample_apps/atmel_studio_template (also an Atmel Studio Project)
